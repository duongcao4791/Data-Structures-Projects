Create a playlist of your favorite songs. Create a shuffle of your songs (permutation of your original songs).

Use the Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle algorithm that works in O(n) running time. 

The basic idea is to start from the last element, swap it with a randomly selected element from the whole array (including last). 

In the next step you will consider the array from 0 to n-2 (size reduced by 1), and repeat the process until you reach the first element. 

Write a program that uses the provided Playlist.txt as input and outputs the shuffled array in a file called LastNameFirstNamePlaylist.txt.
