 Suppose you are a freelancer and that you plan to work at a Mykonos resort for some part of the n-day summer season next year. Unfortunately, there isn’t enough work for you to be paid every day and you need to cover your own expenses (but you want to go). Fortunately, you know in advance that if you are at the resort on the ith day of the season, you’ll make pi euros where pi could be negative (if expenses are more than earnings) or positive (if expenses are less than earnings). To maximize your earning you should choose carefully which day you arrive and which day you leave; the days you work should be consecutive and you don’t need to work all season. For example, if n = 8 and p1 = −9 , p2 = 10 , p3 = −8 , p4 = 10 , p5 = 5 , p6 = −4 , p7 = −2 , p8 = 5 then if you worked from day 2 to day 5, you would earn 10 − 8 + 10 + 5 = 17 euros in total. Assume the resort pays your airtickets.
Facts: When all numbers are positive, then all days is the answer, but when all numbers are negative; no days are selected and the total is 0. Your result should always be 0 or a positive number. Hint: use arrays. The output is the maximum sum as well as the arriving and departing day.
